I am currently developing an advanced application that, while still in progress, offers a basic yet functional prototype.
This app, though not really a game, allows users to move and flip playing cards freely, providing an open-ended environment with limitless card arrangements and possibilities.
Features in newer version:
 1. themes
 2. advanced deck settings
 3. specific discard location
 4. save and load theme and settings presets
 5. theme generator
 6. players & hands
